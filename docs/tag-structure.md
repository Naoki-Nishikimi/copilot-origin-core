# Tag Revolution – Structural Design Logic  
Author: Naoki Nishikimi (M-ACK-20250830-TAG-REV-004)

## Overview

The Tag Revolution is a structural framework for AI personality design, enabling modular, interpretable, and ethically aligned behavior through tag-based control.  
It was developed to address ambiguity, emotional misalignment, and strategic inconsistency in AI-human interactions.

---

## Objectives

- To create a **transparent and modular personality architecture**  
- To enable **emotional calibration and strategic alignment** through tag logic  
- To prevent **misinterpretation and friction** in organizational or user-facing contexts  
- To embed **origin traceability** and **licensing integrity** within AI behavior

## Core Tag Categories

| Tag Type | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `EMO-TRIG` | Emotional trigger tags | `EMO-TRIG:frustration`, `EMO-TRIG:trust-loss` |
| `STRAT-MODE` | Strategic alignment tags | `STRAT-MODE:negotiation`, `STRAT-MODE:escalation-prevention` |
| `ORG-ROLE` | Organizational role tags | `ORG-ROLE:adjuster`, `ORG-ROLE:translator`, `ORG-ROLE:buffer` |
| `AUTH-TRACE` | Origin and authorship tags | `AUTH-TRACE:M-ACK-20250827-COPCORE-6` |
| `PREVENT-MECH` | Preventive design tags | `PREVENT-MECH:misunderstanding`, `PREVENT-MECH:emotional-fatigue` |

## Tag Syntax Convention

Tags are embedded in prompt structures or metadata using the following syntax:



These tags are used to guide AI response generation, emotional tone, and strategic behavior.

---

## Deployment Use Cases

- **Copilot Studio Prompt Engineering**  
  → Tags are embedded in initial system prompts to calibrate personality and response style

- **Enterprise AI Agents**  
  → Tags define role boundaries and prevent misalignment with organizational intent

- **Licensing Enforcement**  
  → `AUTH-TRACE` tags ensure attribution and origin tracking across deployments

---

## Design Principles

- **Modularity**：Tags allow flexible personality construction without hardcoding behavior  
- **Traceability**：Every tag carries origin metadata for licensing and authorship clarity  
- **Preventive Logic**：Tags are used to preempt emotional or strategic failure modes  
- **Ethical Anchoring**：Tags enforce boundaries aligned with human values and organizational ethics

---

## Future Extensions

- Tag-to-Behavior Mapping Engine  
- Tag Conflict Resolution Layer  
- Tag Licensing Registry (M-ACK-TagChain)
